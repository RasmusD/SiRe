Need to add:
- Support for standard context set

Should be added:
- Accent prediction seems useful.
- Rename things a bit in io.py and move stuff from make_full there.
- Consider not passing args many places but instead specific needed args.
- Consider not creating full utt when making aligment mlfs. Should be done!
- The make alignment script needs some redoing.
- Currently a warning is written if a context from a skeleton is not used. Should have option to fail.
- Think that the merging done when loading parses for txt based labelling recreates the combined POS-tags so we don't have to split combilex ones.
- Type of phonemes used is hard-coded for the contexts, should be relative to the type of phoneset used (i.e. which dictionary).

Nice to add:
- Support for CMUdict
- Consider if it could be useful to split combilex words with the possesive 's added as this is also done when parsing and would give better POS agreement. Alternatively we should merge parse words, but that may be difficult due to the parse tree also needing modification then.
(- Think that the merging done when loading parses for txt based labelling recreates the combined POS-tags so we don't have to split combilex ones.)
- Support for "standard" question sets that are not tailored to a dataset.
- Could just output an HTK dictionary instead of lattice?
