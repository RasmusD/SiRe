Need to add:
- Option to choose which pause phoneme to use for alignment.
- Combilex uses three levels of syllable stress (0, 1, 2) but they are not order (0 - no stress, 1 - primary stress, 2 - secondary stress) which is annoying as higher/lower than questions become meaningless as a consequence (or at least harder for the dec tree to deal with). This should be changed when loading combilex but is kept currently for compatibility reasons.
- Option to use punct as sil and change general sil phoneme when making lattices and mlfs.
- Documentation

Should be added:
- When splitting n't words should put the n with the t and not split those.
- Consider not passing args many places but instead specific needed args. This should be done! (It involves many more checks many places but it is probably better than relying on remembering to add these things for different things that need an utt from text.)
- Currently a warning is written if a context from a skeleton is not used. Should have option to fail.
- Add option to pass own arguments to LM binary in txt2lmscore.py and possibly also to parser in txt2parse.py. This should be modelled on make_phoneme_lm
- Reverse engineer the PBT tokenisation of the Stanford parser. Will avoid the hack of merging and splitting.
- Option to use different silence phoneme for midsentential silence than sentence boundary silence.
- Leafs should be renamed leaves

Consider To Add/Change:
- Consider not creating full utt when making aligment mlfs and slfs at the same time. Currently phonemisations are sort of created twice.
- It may be better to put check_dictionary into dictionary.py
- The comma_is_pause option should probably be implemented differently.
- Also consider only either splitting or merging. If nto splitting could simply let words be both beginning and end. Merging is probably better.
- Think that the merging done when loading parses for txt based labelling recreates the combined POS-tags so we don't have to split combilex ones.
- Consider if it could be useful to split combilex words with the possesive 's added as this is also done when parsing and would give better POS agreement. Alternatively we should merge parse words, but that may be difficult due to the parse tree also needing modification then.
- Move add_festival from contexts to basic contexts.
- Make contexts figure out which type of context to create using args.

Nice to add:
- Actual tests.
(- Think that the merging done when loading parses for txt based labelling recreates the combined POS-tags so we don't have to split combilex ones.)
- Support for "standard" question sets that are not tailored to a dataset.
- Could just output an HTK dictionary instead of lattice?
- Matching of txt names to output in both txt2lmscore and txt2parse relies on position in txt dir and could perhaps be done better.
- Plotting f0 on own plot.
- Adding alignment info to plot?
- Support for loading of parsing features etc. when loading a SiRe created full-context label.
- Migration to Python 3.x
- Make an all-in-one integrated label creation from phone lm instead of current seperate steps.
