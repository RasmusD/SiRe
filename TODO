Need to add:
- Should be able to load own utterances again.
- Option to choose which pause phoneme to use for alignment.
- SiReExcercise should excercise parsed versions of SiRe too.

Should be added:
- When splitting n't words should put the n with the t and not split those.
- Accent prediction seems useful.
- Consider not passing args many places but instead specific needed args. This should be done! (It involves many more checks many places but it is probably better than relying on remembering to add these things for different things that need an utt from text.)
- Currently a warning is written if a context from a skeleton is not used. Should have option to fail.
- Add option to pass own arguments to LM binary in txt2lmscore.py and possibly also to parser in txt2parse.py. This should be modelled on make_phoneme_lm
- Test -no_tmp_file option in txt2lmscore.py. Current PC has RAM issues so not possible.
- Reverse engineer the PBT tokenisation of the Stanford parser. Will avoid the hack of merging and splitting.
- Option to use different silence phoneme for midsentential silence than sentence boundary silence.
- Files in combilex dir should not be prespecified as combilex.dict and .add
- Leafs should be renamed leaves

Consider To Add/Change:
- The dictionary should store its entries differently, probably as a dict containing a list of syllables which is a tuple of phonemes and stress value
- Consider not creating full utt when making aligment mlfs and slfs at the same time. Currently phonemisations are sort of created twice.
- It may be better to put check_dictionary into dictionary.py
- The comma_is_pause option should probably be implemented differently.
- Also consider only either splitting or merging. If nto splitting could simply let words be both beginning and end.
- Think that the merging done when loading parses for txt based labelling recreates the combined POS-tags so we don't have to split combilex ones.
- Consider if it could be useful to split combilex words with the possesive 's added as this is also done when parsing and would give better POS agreement. Alternatively we should merge parse words, but that may be difficult due to the parse tree also needing modification then.

Nice to add:
- Actrual tests.
- Support for CMUdict
- Make make_entry in dictionary.py output either combilex or cmudict format.
(- Think that the merging done when loading parses for txt based labelling recreates the combined POS-tags so we don't have to split combilex ones.)
- Support for "standard" question sets that are not tailored to a dataset.
- Could just output an HTK dictionary instead of lattice?
- Matching of txt names to output in both txt2lmscore and txt2parse relies on position in txt dir and could perhaps be done better.
- Plotting f0 on own plot.
- Adding alignment info to plot?
